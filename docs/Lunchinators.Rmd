Cleaning the data

- Got rid of pay in hourly format
- Eliminated people with no gender or position listed
  - Biased towards binary gender standard
- Some departments are funded by two different colleges
  - EEOB las vs EEOB agls
  - Usually one has more people than the other - combined! 
  
Problems 
- More people in salary database than in Iowa State directory
  - 229 people with "prof" in their title. Not sure why, span various years and positions. Perhaps opted out of the directory. 
- Duplicate names! Directory doesn't include middle initials....
- Some departments have changed names..
