# Motivation

- Package for class in spring of 2019 (STAT 585)

- How does pay compare for women and men in the Agronomy department?

# Where does this data come from?



You (maybe) need an API to access it all

# Cleaning the data

### Two datasets

- Got rid of pay in hourly format
- Eliminated people with no gender or position listed
- Some departments are funded by two different colleges
  - EEOB-las vs EEOB-agls
  - Usually one has more people than the other - combined! 
- Filtered for 'PROF' titles only 
  
---
  
# Problems 
- More people in salary database than in Iowa State directory
  - 229 people with "prof" in their title. Not sure why, span various years and positions. Perhaps opted out of the directory. 
- Duplicate names! Directory doesn't include middle initials....
- Some departments have changed names..
