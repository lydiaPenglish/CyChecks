###  Data cleaning & issues
***
.large[Tidying government salary data]

--

- Got rid of pay in hourly format.

--

- Eliminated people with no gender or position listed.

--

- Filtered for _PROF_ titles only 

--

- Some departments are funded by two different colleges:
  - EEOB-las vs EEOB-agls
  
  


---
###  Data cleaning & <span style="color:red">issues</span>
***

- Directory database from Iowa State University (2012 - 2019)

--

- More people in salary database than in Iowa State directory
  - 229 people with "prof" in their title. Not sure why, span various years and positions. Perhaps opted out of the directory? 

--

- **Duplicate names!** ISU directory doesn't include middle initials....
  - Went through by hand and googled those people

--

- Some departments have changed names over time
  - Ex. "curr/instr" is now "school of ed"

--

- 7 professors have a department listing of a center, but have a different "tenure home"  

--

- Majority of people don't have a base salary listed, just a total salary paid. 
  - Most profs had base salary listed. 

---
### Data visualization with Shiny
***
```{r}
# CyChecks2::cy_RunShiny()
```

---
### Data modeling (help!)
***
- Variables: Base salary ; position, gender, department, fiscal year

--


- We want to know which departments don't have good gender representation or pay equity
  - Ideally we want to rank departments by equity or lack there of
  
--


- Not every department has M & F employeees in all positions 
  - How do we include those departments with no gender representation. NAs are meaningful!

---
### Data modeling (help!)
***
.large[*Response variables:*]
.pull-left[
.large[log(Salary)]
- Gender needs to be included in the model
]  
.pull-right[
.large[log(Ratio of Salaries)]
- Gender "effect" emcompassed in the response term
]  

---
### Data modeling (help!)
***

.large[*Response variables = log(salary) *]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lmerTest::lmer(log_sal ~ position * gender + (1 + gender | dept), data = ex_all, REML = F)
```

- Filtered out position/department combos without both genders. 
- Repeated sampling of fiscal year encompassed within department...(?)
  - Adding name or fiscal year as a random effect doesn't work

---
### Data modeling (help!)
***
.large[*Response variables = log(salary) *]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lmerTest::lmer(log_ratio ~ position + (1 | dept), data = lrat_all)
```
