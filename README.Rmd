*Overview*

The goal of CyChecks3 is to allow users easy access to the publicly available Iowa State University (the Cyclones) employee salary data (their checks). 

Some of the services this access could offer include:

1. Aid job seekers in negotiating starting salaries.
2. Shed light on possible pay inequities with respect to gender.
3. Identify positions that are lacking gender diversity.

*Background*

The state of Iowa offers a large amount of public data at [this site](https://data.iowa.gov/). You can access the data with or without an API token, but can sign up for one [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.iowa.gov/s3p7-wy6w). 
Iowa state employee salaries are available at [this site](https://data.iowa.gov/State-Finances/State-of-Iowa-Salary-Book/s3p7-wy6w). **CyChecks2 provides a function to easily scrape this data for any given year** 

The data from this site does not include the employee's home department. Unfortunately, to our knowledge the data linking names to departments is not easily accessible. ISU's Human Resources Department kindly provided a list of employees with their home departments and associated colleges valid from January 1 2008 - January 1 2018. Since acquiring this information is not reproducible to the average user, we've included a full dataset (with names anonymized) of all salary info (2007 - 2019) cross-referenced by department in the CyChecks2 package. Many employees (XX) appeared in the public data, but were not included in the list provided to us by ISU. This isn't ideal, and we hope ISU will provide complete public access to department affiliations in the future. 

*Summary*

This package currently includes:

1. Data from:
    (i) Salary data for all employees for fiscal years 2007-2019.
This data is accessed by calling **salaries**
    (ii) ISU affiliations, as received from HR.
This data is accessed by calling **affiliation**
    (iii) Salary/department dataset for employees with the string 'prof' in their position title, currently for fiscal years 2012-2019, containing only the following categories:
    - assoc prof
    - asst prof
    - distg prof
    - morrill prof
    - prof
    - univ prof
This data is accessed by calling **professors**. Note this data is the result of merging salary data with affiliation data, and required a fair amount of manual manipulation due to spelling errors, inconsistencies, etc. 


2. A shiny app for visualizing data (still in the works)
